**Project Name: URLShortener**
**Project Description**
This project is designed to enhance my skills in making API calls while also providing my first experience with the Angular framework. It integrates ASP.NET MVC for the backend and Angular for the frontend, offering a full-stack experience. The goal is to learn and improve key concepts in both technologies, focusing on building robust web applications.

**Key Objectives**
Improve API integration: Mastering API calls and interactions within an ASP.NET MVC environment.
Learn Angular: My first experience with Angular, exploring how to create dynamic, single-page applications.
Implement Full-Stack Development: Integrating frontend requests with backend logic, ensuring seamless communication between both layers.

**Features:**
API Integration: Making API calls to retrieve data and manage resources.
User Authentication: Building a basic authentication system for user registration and login.
Role-Based Access: Differentiating functionality based on user roles (Admin vs User).
CRUD Operations: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities through the backend.
URL Shortening: URL shortening service that also provides detailed information about each shortened URL.

**Technologies Used**
**Backend:**
ASP.NET MVC
Entity Framework
Identity Framework
SQL Server
SQL Server Management Studio
**Frontend:**
Angular 18
TypeScript
Authentication:
JWT tokens
**Testing:**
XUnit, Moq, FakeItEasy

**Lessons Learned**
ASP.NET MVC: Gained a solid understanding of building MVC-based web applications, working with controllers and models.
Angular Framework: My first hands-on experience with Angular, where I learned about components, services, and routing.
User Authentication: Implemented authentication using JWT tokens, Claims and Identity Framework for user login and session management.
Full-Stack Integration: Successfully integrated frontend and backend components, ensuring smooth data flow between the Angular frontend and the ASP.NET MVC backend.
**Future Improvements**
Add unit tests for both the frontend and backend.
Implement error handling for API calls.
Add pagination and filtering to the URLs list.
Use environment variables for configuration settings.
Add more advanced features such as email notifications for URL creation or updates.
**Conclusion**
This project has been an excellent learning experience, enhancing both my backend and frontend skills. It has provided a solid foundation for building full-stack web applications, and I'm excited to continue improving and expanding this project.
